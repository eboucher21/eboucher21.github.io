## Introduction
Hello, my name is Evan Boucher.

## Purpose 
The purpose of this page is to show the improvement of my skills by taking a previously made project, and enhance it in three different ways. The project I chose is an arena shooter game that I created in a college class. The enchancements I have made to this project are split into three main categories; Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. Before working on the enhancements I reviewed the original code in the project to show where I am starting from, and to outline my goals.
